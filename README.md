<h1>Binary Class</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
A class which contains an std::string data member, and holds a binary value in it. (example: "10010011")<br>
The class can be initialized using decimal values (ints), or by string values, which all get converted and stripped into a binary value, which then gets assigned to the std::string data member.<br>
